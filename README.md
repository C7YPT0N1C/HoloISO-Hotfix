# HoloISO Hotfix - A Hotfix script for [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso) Issues.

**THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN CODED TO ENSURE THAT YOUR SYSTEM WON'T GET BORKED, BUT IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**UPDATE: Changed repo to read-only. Code will still be available to fork, but I will no longer be maintaining it.**

If this does not work for you, please tell me what happens by opening an [Issue](https://github.com/C7YPT0N1C/HoloISOHotfix/issues/new)!

<br/>**INSTAll INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN RELEASE NOTES.**

<br/>**NOTES:**
<br/>\- You may have to reboot your device a few times for the OS to fully boot up. If a kernel doesn't work, try a different one.
<br/>\- This hotfix script will be updated if a new hotfix is found. Please re-download and run the new script to patch HoloISO.
<br/>\- Please keep in mind that when the script runs, mesa-amber will be installed to replace mesa, mesa and mesa-amber both being the 3d graphics library Holoiso / SteamOS use. You can switch to any version of mesa, and see if that works better for you.
<br/>\- Please keep in mind that this script *may* have unintended side effects if you have more than 1 user on your system (?).
