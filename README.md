# HoloISO Hotfix - A Hotfix script for [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso) Issues.

**THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN CODED TO ENSURE THAT YOUR SYSTEM WON'T GET BORKED, BUT IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**UPDATE: As of writing this, HoloISO is very unstable. I would reccommend [ChimeraOS](chimeraos.org/), as it has the same UI and features (?), but is MUCH more stable.**

<br/>**Latest HoloISO Version: v4.1**

**Successful HoloISO Versions:**
<br/>\- HoloISOv4.1v2 (ISO No Longer Available) Works With [HoloISOHotfix v2](https://github.com/C7YPT0N1C/HoloISOHotfix/releases/tag/HoloISOv4.1v2)
<br/>\- HoloISOv4.1v1 (ISO No Longer Available) Works With [HoloISOHotfix v2](https://github.com/C7YPT0N1C/HoloISOHotfix/releases/tag/HoloISOv4.1v2)

**Unsuccessful HoloISO Versions:**
<br/>\- [HoloISOv4.2_6.1-mesa23-test (Direct ISO Download)](https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso/suites/11660907619/artifacts/605836072)
<br/>\- [HoloISOv4.2_6.1-test (Direct ISO Download)](https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso/suites/11524767163/artifacts/596186278)

<br/>INSTAll INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN RELEASE NOTES.

<br/>**NOTES:**
<br/>\- You may have to reboot your device a few times for the OS to fully boot up. If a kernel doesn't work, try a different one.
<br/>\- This hotfix script will be updated if a new hotfix is found. Please re-download and run the new script to patch HoloISO.
<br/>\- Please keep in mind that when the script runs, mesa-amber will be installed to replace mesa, mesa and mesa-amber both being the 3d graphics library Holoiso / SteamOS use. You can switch to any version of mesa, and see if that works better for you.
<br/>\- Please keep in mind that this script *may* have unintended side effects if you have more than 1 user on your system (?).
